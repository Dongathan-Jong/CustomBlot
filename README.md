A blot that can draw 30cm x 50cm! Controlled with an arduino and 4 stepper motors, it runs the GRBL firmware and uses the CNC shield with 4 a4988 stepper drivers. 

I built this as a project to pass the time while waiting for an acutal hack club blot, but it turned into an adventure of pen plotters, GRBL, and much much more. 

if you would like to create your own, here are the parts I used to build the project:
3x 2020 aluminium extrusions (I used 1M here but you can use any length youd like)

3x V-slot gantry plates + POM wheels (These are 3D printable, but they have horrible tolerances and are not rigid enough for precise drawings)

A ton of m5 bolts, washers, nuts, and V groove nuts. (didn't really keep count of how many!)

1x Arduino + CNC sheild + 4x a4988 Motor drivers

1x 5m GT2 belt

3x belt tensioner

1x Linear rail (you only need 10cm/100mm)

and a ton of 3d printed parts!
